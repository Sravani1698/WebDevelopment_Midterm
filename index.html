                                    In physics, the principle of relativity is the requirement that the equations describing the laws of physics 
                                    have the same form in all admissible frames of reference. For example, in the framework of special relativity
                                    the Maxwell equations have the same form in all inertial frames of reference. In the framework of general relativity 
                                    the Maxwell equations or the Einstein field equations have the same form in arbitrary frames of reference.

                                    natural laws, but explains the macroscopic behavior of nature from the behavior of such ensembles. Its main 
                                    purpose is to clarify the properties of matter in aggregate, in terms of physical laws governing atomic motion.

                                    In Physics, Quantum mechanics is a fundamental theory in physics that describes the behavior of nature at the 
                                    scale of atoms and subatomic particles. It is the foundation of all quantum physics including quantum 
                                    chemistry, quantum field theory, quantum technology, and quantum information science. Most theories in classical
                                     physics can be derived from quantum mechanics as an approximation valid at large (macroscopic) scale.

                                    In physics, electromagnetism is an interaction that occurs between particles with electric charge 
                                    via electromagnetic fields. The electromagnetic force is one of the four fundamental forces of nature.
                                    It is the dominant force in the interactions of atoms and molecules. Electromagnetism can be thought of as a 
                                    combination of electrostatics and magnetism, two distinct but closely intertwined phenomena.

                        <p> <b> Insight,Law mass equivalence</b> 
                            Over a century after Einstein’s first derivation of mass-energy equivalence, as his famous
                            result is called because one can select units in which one can express it with an equation
                            of the form E=m
                            , the result continues to receive outstanding empirical support. Furthermore, as the
                            physicist Wolfgang Rindler has pointed out, the result “has been found applicable and valid
                            in many branches of physics, from electromagnetism to general relativity” (Rindler 1991, p.
                            74). Thus, from Rindler’s perspective, which is shared by many physicists, mass-energy
                            equivalence “… is truly a new fundamental principle of physics” (Rindler 1991, p. 74).

                            is, arguably, the most famous equation in 20th century physics. To appreciate what
                            Einstein’s famous result is about, and what it is not about, we begin in Section 1 with a
                            description of the physics of mass-energy equivalence. In Section 2, we survey six distinct,
                            though related, philosophical interpretations of mass-energy equivalence. We then discuss,
                            in Section 3, the history of derivations of mass-energy equivalence and its philosophical
                            importance. Section 4 is a brief and selective account of empirical confirmation of
                            Einstein’s result that focuses on Cockcroft and Walton’s (1932) first confirmation of
                            mass-energy equivalence and a more recent, and very accurate, confirmation by Rainville et
                            al. (2005).
