                            Over a century after Einstein’s first derivation of mass-energy equivalence, as his famous
                            result is called because one can select units in which one can express it with an equation
                            of the form E=m
                            , the result continues to receive outstanding empirical support. Furthermore, as the
                            physicist Wolfgang Rindler has pointed out, the result “has been found applicable and valid
                            in many branches of physics, from electromagnetism to general relativity” (Rindler 1991, p.
                            74). Thus, from Rindler’s perspective, which is shared by many physicists, mass-energy
                            equivalence “… is truly a new fundamental principle of physics” (Rindler 1991, p. 74).

                            is, arguably, the most famous equation in 20th century physics. To appreciate what
                            Einstein’s famous result is about, and what it is not about, we begin in Section 1 with a
                            description of the physics of mass-energy equivalence. In Section 2, we survey six distinct,
                            though related, philosophical interpretations of mass-energy equivalence. We then discuss,
                            in Section 3, the history of derivations of mass-energy equivalence and its philosophical
                            importance. Section 4 is a brief and selective account of empirical confirmation of
                            Einstein’s result that focuses on Cockcroft and Walton’s (1932) first confirmation of
                            mass-energy equivalence and a more recent, and very accurate, confirmation by Rainville et
                            al. (2005).
                            The two main philosophical questions surrounding Einstein’s equation, which are the focus of
